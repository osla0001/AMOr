DATA SOURCES, APIs, AND EXTERNAL SERVICES
==========================================

1. GOOGLE MAPS JAVASCRIPT API
------------------------------
Link: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript
API Key: AIzaSyANajqylsntCiysdQbDUp9eo6fheepBhyw
Version: Beta (v=beta) with Maps and Marker libraries

Licensing & Attribution:
- Subject to Google Maps Platform Terms of Service
- Requires Google attribution on map displays
- Usage tracked and billed according to Google Cloud pricing

Refresh Rate: Real-time / on-demand loading
Update Frequency: N/A (map tiles and geocoding services updated by Google)

Description of Use:
The Google Maps JavaScript API powers the interactive map feature on the /map page. 
It displays restaurant locations as custom markers (pink pins) on a fully interactive 
map of Lisbon. Users can click markers to view restaurant details in a sliding catalog 
panel. The API also provides the Search API (https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1) 
used in restaurant detail pages to link directly to Google Maps for directions.


2. MYSQL DATABASE (GOOGLE CLOUD SQL)
-------------------------------------
Host: 34.175.101.196:3306
Database Name: munchmap
Connection Library: mysql2/promise (Node.js)

Licensing & Attribution:
- MySQL Community Edition (GPL License)
- Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (subject to GCP Terms of Service)
- Database content is proprietary to AMOr project

Refresh Rate: Real-time database queries
Update Frequency: Dynamic - updated as restaurant data is added/modified by administrators

Description of Use:
The MySQL database serves as the central data repository for all restaurant information. 
It contains multiple tables:

- eatery table: Core restaurant data (name, address, coordinates, phone, email, 
  opening hours, background story, amenities like WiFi, outdoor seating, pet-friendly 
  status, LGBT+ friendly, women-owned, local suppliers, payment methods, price range)
- cuisine table: Cuisine types and categories
- eatery_cuisine junction table: Many-to-many relationships between restaurants and cuisines

The database is queried across multiple pages:
- /catalog - Lists all restaurants with search and filter functionality
- /catalog/[etr_name] - Individual restaurant detail pages with complete information
- /map - Provides coordinates and basic info for map markers
- / (homepage) - IndexCatalog component displays featured restaurants
- /api/eateries - Internal API endpoint for fetching restaurant data with client-side caching

Connection pooling is implemented for performance with 10 concurrent connections and 
60-second timeouts to handle network latency to the Google Cloud SQL instance.


3. GOOGLE FONTS API
--------------------
Link: https://fonts.googleapis.com/
Font Family: Commissioner (weights 100-900)

Licensing & Attribution:
- Open Font License (OFL) - free to use commercially
- No attribution required
- Hosted and served by Google Fonts CDN

Refresh Rate: Cached by browser (long-term caching via CDN)
Update Frequency: Static font files

Description of Use:
The Commissioner font family is used throughout the application for body text, 
headings (h2-h5), paragraphs, and UI elements. It provides a clean, modern, 
professional appearance consistent with the brand identity. The font is loaded 
with variable weights (100-900) to support different font-weights across the 
design system.


4. CDN FONTS - MILKY COFFEE
----------------------------
Link: https://fonts.cdnfonts.com/css/milky-coffee
Font Family: Milky Coffee

Licensing & Attribution:
- License terms specified on CDNFonts.com
- Free for personal and commercial use (verify specific license)
- Served via CDNFonts CDN

Refresh Rate: Cached by browser
Update Frequency: Static font files

Description of Use:
The Milky Coffee font serves as the primary display font for the AMOr brand. 
It is used for:
- Main headings (h1 elements)
- Large display titles (h4 elements for decorative purposes)
- Logo and branding elements
- Hero section titles

This decorative font creates the playful, friendly, and approachable brand 
personality that distinguishes AMOr from competitors.


5. INTERNAL REST API - EATERIES ENDPOINT
-----------------------------------------
Endpoint: /api/eateries
Type: Custom Astro API Route
Method: GET

Licensing & Attribution:
- Proprietary to AMOr project
- Internal use only

Refresh Rate: Real-time with 1-minute client-side cache
Update Frequency: Queries MySQL database on each request (after cache expires)

Description of Use:
This internal API endpoint serves as a data layer between the frontend map 
interface and the MySQL database. It:
- Fetches all restaurant data with cuisine information
- Groups multiple cuisines per restaurant (handles many-to-many relationships)
- Returns JSON formatted data with coordinates for map rendering
- Implements CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Provides error handling for database connection failures

The endpoint is consumed by the /map page JavaScript to dynamically populate 
map markers and catalog entries. Client-side caching (localStorage with timestamps) 
reduces unnecessary database queries and improves performance.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
===============================
- All external dependencies are loaded asynchronously to optimize page load performance
- Database connections use connection pooling (10 connections) for scalability
- Font preconnect hints are used to reduce latency for Google Fonts
- API keys and database credentials are stored in environment variables for security
- Error handling is implemented for all external service calls to ensure graceful degradation
